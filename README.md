# Neural ODE Project

This is the Final Project for the lecture "Modelling and Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems in Julia" at the Technical University Munich. The julia package format is used to easily transfer environments, but does not contain actual code itself. The report is written as the documentation, though equivalent Jupyter notebooks and scripts are available in the package repo as well.
